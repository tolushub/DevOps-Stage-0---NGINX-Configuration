# h1 Title: My Journey into DevOps: Setting Up NGINX on Ubuntu 8-)

##**Introduction**
As part of my DevOps learning journey, I was tasked with setting up and configuring NGINX on a fresh Ubuntu server. This task was designed to help me gain hands-on experience with web server configuration and deployment. Here’s how I approached it, the challenges I faced, and what I learned along the way.

**Approach to Completing the Task**
Provisioning the Server: I started by setting up an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server on AWS.

**Installing NGINX:** Using the terminal, I updated the package list and installed NGINX with the command sudo apt install nginx -y.

**Creating a Custom HTML Page:** I created a simple HTML file at /var/www/html/index.html with the message: “Welcome to DevOps Stage 0 - Tolulope OJo/Ops-ack”.

**Testing the Configuration:** After ensuring NGINX was running, I accessed the server’s public IP in my browser and saw the custom page.

##**Challenges Faced**
**Firewall Issues:** Initially, I couldn’t access the server because the firewall was blocking HTTP traffic. I resolved this by allowing all traffic for the inbound rule on AWS.

##**Learning and Professional Growth**
This task taught me the basics of web server configuration and how to troubleshoot common issues. It also reinforced my understanding of Linux commands and server management. As someone aspiring to become a DevOps engineer, this hands-on experience was invaluable.
